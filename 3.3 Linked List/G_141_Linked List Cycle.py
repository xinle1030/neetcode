"""
Detect loop in a linked list using Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one. 
- The faster one is called the faster pointer.
- The other one is called the slow pointer.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Similar to Leetcode 142_LinkedList Cycle II
